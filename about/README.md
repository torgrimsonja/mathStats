ABOUT:

The mathStats Program was created for the math and science teachers at TFHS by IT Helpdesk Students to aid the teachers in creating graphs based off of uploaded CSV file values on Temperature.

HOW TO:
=======
To create a graph, simply upload or choose a file using the 'Choose File' Button, or by selecting a previously uploaded file from the dropdown selection list.  Then select the desired type of graph(pie, line, or bar) and press GO.  Your graph will display along with options for printing and downloading the chart.
