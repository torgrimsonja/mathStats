      Website Plan
--------------------------------

1. User inputs file and chooses type
2. Clicks button
3. Client creates GLOBAL variable storing name of file and chartType
4. Page changes to display page
4. Runs ajax call to store file and getFileData, then echos it as a JSON string for Ajax call
5. Ajax call success function is passed the JSON string with contents of the file they submitted
6. Parse and shove returned data into necessary functions for Highcharts
7. Once data is given to Highcharts, the graph will display in the container div-- VOila!
