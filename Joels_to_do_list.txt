Exporting Stuff

Minor To Do List
----------------
1. Code post array qualifier so php knows not to check for uploaded files when a loaded file is chosen

3. Finish data parsing in php for highchart to be passed through ajax
	-echo at correct location and in correct syntax with date, time, and temperature data for ajax call

4.  Add code to check for selected radio button and make sure to echo the selected number(1,2, or 3 for pie, line, and bar respectively) before echoing anything else, so that it will be the first line printed by main.php and found by the ajax call

 *Clean up the filesystem, modularize the php?*

--------------------------------
Chronological Ordering of Website
	       ----
1. Run Index and Load Form for User Input
2. On Form Submit, run main.php and echo necessary data for ajax
3. Once the data has been echoed, run a separate html page for just displaying the graph and export options, using data from php that can be seen by ajax

*Possible Problems:*
Echoed data no longer being visible once 2nd html page and global runs
